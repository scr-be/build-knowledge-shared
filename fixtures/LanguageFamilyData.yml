                Afroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian and traditionally as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic),
                is a large language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. It comprises about 300 or
                so living languages and dialects, according to the 2009 Ethnologue estimate. It includes languages
                spoken predominantly in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel. The
                Afroasiatic family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the longest recorded
                history of any language family.

            description: |
                The Algonquian languages (/ælˈɡɒŋkwiən/ or /ælˈɡɒŋkiən/; also Algonkian) are a subfamily of Native American
                languages which includes most of the languages in the Algic language family. The name of the Algonquian
                language family is distinguished from the orthographically similar Algonquin dialect of the indigenous Ojibwe
                language (Chippewa), which is a senior member of the Algonquian language family. The term "Algonquin" has
                been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elakómkwik (pronounced [ɛlæˈɡomoɡwik]), "they are our
                relatives/allies". A number of Algonquian languages, like many of the Iroquoian languages of the hereditary
                enemies of the Algonquian peoples, have already become extinct.

            description : |
                The Austroasiatic languages, in recent classifications synonymous with Mon–Khmer, are a large language family
                of continental Southeast Asia, also scattered throughout India, Bangladesh, and the southern border of China.
                The name Austroasiatic comes from the Latin words for "south" and "Asia", hence "South Asia". Of these languages,
                only Khmer, Vietnamese, and Mon have a long-established recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have
                official status (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups.
                Ethnologue identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps Shompen,
                which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer and Munda.
                However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and Khasi-Khmuic) while another
                has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.

            description : |
                The Austronesian languages is a language family that is widely dispersed throughout Maritime Southeast Asia,
                Madagascar and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, with a few members on continental Asia. Austronesian languages
                are spoken by about 386 million people. It is on par with Indo-European, Niger–Congo, Afroasiatic and Uralic as
                one of the best-established language families. Otto Dempwolff was the first researcher to extensively explore
                Austronesian using the comparative method. Another German, Wilhelm Schmidt, coined the German word austronesisch
                which comes from Latin auster "south wind" plus Greek nêsos "island". The name Austronesian was formed from the
                same roots. The family is aptly named, as the vast majority of Austronesian languages are spoken on islands: only
                a few languages, such as Malay and the Chamic languages, are indigenous to mainland Asia. Many Austronesian languages
                have very few speakers, but the major Austronesian languages are spoken by tens of millions of people and one
                Austronesian language, Malay, is spoken by 250 million people, making it the 8th most spoken language in the world.
                Twenty or so Austronesian languages are official in their respective countries (see the list of major and official
                Austronesian languages).

            description : |
                Aymaran (also Jaqi, Aru, Jaqui, Aimara, Haki) is one of the two dominant language families of the central Andes,
                along with Quechuan. Hardman (1978) proposed the name Jaqi for the family of languages (1978), Alfredo Torero Aru
                'to speak', and Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino Aymaran, with two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymaran and Central
                Aymaran (Jaqaru and Kawki). Quechuan languages, especially those of the south, share a large amount of vocabulary
                with Aymara, and the languages have often been grouped together as Quechumaran. This proposal is controversial,
                however; the shared vocabulary may be better explained as intensive borrowing due to long-term contact.

            description : |
                A planned or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and
                vocabulary have been consciously devised for human or human-like communication, instead of having developed
                naturally. It is also referred to as an artificial or invented language. There are many possible reasons
                to create a constructed language, such as: to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language
                and code), to give fiction or an associated constructed world an added layer of realism during worldbuilding,
                for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning, for artistic creation,
                and for language games.

            description : |
                A creole language, or simply creole, is a stable natural language that has developed from a pidgin, i.e. a
                simplified version of a language. Creoles differ from pidgins because creoles have been nativized by children
                as their primary language, with the result that they have features of natural languages that are normally
                missing from pidgins, which are not anyone's first language. The precise number of creoles is not known,
                particularly as these are poorly attested, but about one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500,
                predominantly based on European languages, due to the Age of Discovery and the Atlantic slave trade, though
                there are creoles based on other languages, including Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest
                number of speakers is Haitian Creole, with about ten million native speakers. The lexicon of a creole language
                is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context
                of the creole's construction, though there are often clear phonetic and semantic shifts. On the other hand, the
                grammar often has original features that may differ substantially from those of the parent languages.

                Dené–Yeniseian is a proposed language family consisting of the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia and the
                Na-Dené languages of northwestern North America. It has been called "the first demonstration of a genealogical
                link between Old World and New World language families that meets the standards of traditional comparative-historical
                linguistics". If valid, it would be the second linguistic connection between the Old and New Worlds, with the
                first being the Yupik languages.

            description : |
                The Dravidian languages are a language family spoken mainly in southern India and parts of eastern and central
                India as well as in northeastern Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and overseas in other countries such
                as Malaysia and Singapore. The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.
                There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes, who live beyond the mainstream communities,
                such as the Kurukh and Gond tribes. It is often considered that Dravidian languages are native to India.
                Epigraphically the Dravidian languages have been attested since the 2nd century BCE. Only two Dravidian languages
                are exclusively spoken outside India, Brahui in Pakistan and Dhangar, a dialect of Kurukh, in Nepal.

            description : |
                Eskimo–Aleut or Eskaleut is a language family native to Alaska, the Canadian Arctic, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut,
                Greenland, and the Chukchi Peninsula on the eastern tip of Siberia. It is also known as Eskaleutian, Eskaleutic,
                 or Inuit–Yupik-Unangan. The Eskimo–Aleut language family is divided into two branches, the Eskimo languages and
                 the Aleut language. The Aleut language family consists of a single language, Aleut, spoken in the Aleutian
                 Islands and the Pribilof Islands. Aleut is divided into several dialects. The Eskimo languages are divided into
                 two branches, the Yupik languages, spoken in western and southwestern Alaska and in easternmost Siberia, and the
                 Inuit languages, spoken in northern Alaska, in Canada, and in Greenland. Inuit, which covers a huge range of
                 territory, is divided into several varieties. Neighbouring varieties are quite similar, although those at the
                 farthest distances from the centre in the Diomede Islands and East Greenland are quite divergent.

            description : |
                The Indo-European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445
                Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by Ethnologue, with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to
                the Indo-Iranian branch alone. The Indo-European family includes most major current languages of South Asia,
                Europe, and parts of Western and Central Asia. It was also predominant in ancient Anatolia (present-day Turkey),
                and the ancient Tarim Basin (present-day Northwest China). With written attestations appearing since the Bronze
                Age in the form of the Anatolian languages and Mycenaean Greek, the Indo-European family is significant to the
                field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history, after the Afroasiatic family.

                The Japonic language family includes the Japanese language spoken on the main islands of Japan as well as the
                Ryukyuan languages spoken in the Ryukyu Islands. The family is widely accepted by linguists, and the term
                "Japonic languages" was coined by Leon Serafim. The common ancestral language is known as Proto-Japonic. The
                essential feature of this classification is that the first split in the family resulted in the separation of all
                dialects of Japanese from all varieties of Ryukyuan. According to Shiro Hattori, this separation occurred during
                the Yamato period (250–710).

                The Koreanic languages is a language family consisting of the modern Korean language together with extinct
                ancient relatives closer to it than to any proposed links with Mongolic, Turkic, Tungusic, or Japanese. Among
                extant languages, Korean is considered by most linguists to be a language isolate, and by others as part of
                the widely rejected Altaic family. The Jeju language of Jeju Island, considered by some as a dialect of modern
                Korean, is distinct enough to be considered a language in its own right by other authorities. Some consider that
                rather than being a language isolate, Korean forms a small language family together with Jeju.

            description : |
                A language isolate, in the absolute sense, is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical (or
                "genetic") relationship with other languages, one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor
                common with any other language. Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single
                language. Commonly cited examples include Basque, Korean, Ainu, Sumerian and Burushaski, though in each case
                a small minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages. Some sources use
                the term "language isolate" to indicate a branch of a larger family with only one surviving daughter. For
                instance, Albanian, Armenian and Greek are commonly called Indo-European isolates. While part of the Indo-European
                family, they do not belong to any established branch (like the Romance, Indo-Iranian, Slavic or Germanic branches),
                but instead form independent branches of their own. Similarly, within the Romance languages, Sardinian is a
                relative isolate. However, without a qualifier, isolate is understood to be in the absolute sense of having no
                demonstrable genetic relationship to any other known language.

                The Mongolic languages are a group of languages spoken in East-Central Asia, mostly in Mongolia and surrounding
                areas plus in Kalmykia. The best-known member of this language family, Mongolian, is the primary language of
                most of the residents of Mongolia and the Mongolian residents of Inner Mongolia, China with an estimated 5.7+
                million speakers. The closest relative of the Mongolic languages appears to be the extinct language Khitan.
                Some linguists have grouped Mongolic with Turkic, Tungusic, and possibly Koreanic and Japonic as part of a
                larger Altaic family, but this has been widely discredited.

            description : |
                The Niger–Congo languages constitute one of the world's major language families, and Africa's largest in terms
                of geographical area, number of speakers, and number of distinct languages. They may constitute the world's
                largest language family in terms of distinct languages, although this question is complicated by ambiguity
                about what constitutes a distinct language. A characteristic common to most Niger–Congo languages is the use of
                a noun class system. The most widely spoken Niger–Congo languages by number of native speakers are Yoruba, Igbo,
                Fula, Shona and Zulu. The most widely spoken by total number of speakers is Swahili. Some scholars have doubted
                whether Niger–Congo is a valid genetic unit or rather a typological grouping, but most specialists today consider
                it to be a valid family, although there is no consensus on the subclassification.

                The Sino-Tibetan languages are a family of more than 400 languages spoken in East Asia, Southeast Asia and
                parts of South Asia. The family is second only to the Indo-European languages in terms of the number of
                native speakers. The Sino-Tibetan languages with the most native speakers are the varieties of Chinese
                (1.2 billion speakers), Burmese (33 million) and the Tibetic languages (8 million). Many Sino-Tibetan languages
                are spoken by small communities in remote mountain areas and are poorly documented.

                The Kartvelian languages (Georgian: ქართველური ენები) (also known as Iberian and formerly South Caucasian)
                are a language family indigenous to the Caucasus and spoken primarily in Georgia, with large groups of native
                speakers in Russia, Iran, the United States, the European Union, Israel, and northeastern parts of Turkey.
                There are approximately 5.2 million speakers of Kartvelian languages worldwide. It is not known to be related
                to any other language family, making it one of the world's primary language families. The first literary
                source in a Kartvelian language is the Georgian language inscription of Bir El Qutt, written in ancient
                Georgian Asomtavruli script at the Georgian monastery near Bethlehem, which dates back to c. 430 AD.

                The Tai–Kadai languages, also known as Daic, Kadai, Kradai, or Kra–Dai, are a language family of highly
                tonal languages found in southern China and Southeast Asia. They include Thai and Lao, the national
                languages of Thailand and Laos respectively. There are nearly 100 million speakers of these languages
                in the world. Ethnologue lists 95 languages in this family, with 62 of these being in the Tai branch.
                The diversity of the Tai–Kadai languages in southeastern China, especially in Guizhou and Hainan, suggests
                that this is close to their homeland. The Tai branch moved south into Southeast Asia only about a thousand
                years ago, founding the nations that later became Thailand and Laos in what had been Austroasiatic territory.
